# Incorrect Conditional Statement Bug in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common bug in TypeScript: an incorrect conditional statement that leads to unexpected behavior.  The function `printOddNumbers` is intended to print only odd numbers, but due to a flawed `if/else` structure, it prints "BUG!!!" regardless of whether the number is odd or even.

The solution provided addresses this logic error, ensuring the function behaves as intended.
